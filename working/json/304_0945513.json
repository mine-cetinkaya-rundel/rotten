In an assignment unlike any he's ever known, he learns he's part of a government experiment called the Source Code, a program that enables him to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack. -- (C) Summit","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00hebfLNs8BxrCx4xkZ145CNGD8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177840_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00hebfLNs8BxrCx4xkZ145CNGD8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177840_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00hebfLNs8BxrCx4xkZ145CNGD8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177840_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00hebfLNs8BxrCx4xkZ145CNGD8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177840_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","id":"162653968","characters":["Capt.
