John Carter is based on a classic novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose highly imaginative adventures served as inspiration for many filmmakers, both past and present. The film tells the story of war-weary, former military captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands. -- (C) Walt Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CVSTU2x5BpYgHvl5VEmSV1cvc0Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/39/11163924_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CVSTU2x5BpYgHvl5VEmSV1cvc0Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/39/11163924_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CVSTU2x5BpYgHvl5VEmSV1cvc0Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/39/11163924_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CVSTU2x5BpYgHvl5VEmSV1cvc0Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/39/11163924_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Taylor Kitsch","id":"326299816","characters":["John Carter"]},{"name":"Lynn Collins","id":"162684234","characters":["Dejah Thoris"]},{"name":"Samantha Morton","id":"162655611","characters":["Sola"]},{"name":"Willem Dafoe","id":"162668400","characters":["Tars Tarkas"]},{"name":"Thomas Haden Church","id":"162683650","characters":["Tal Hajus"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"name":"Mark Atkins"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0401729"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0401729","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_carter/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801433/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801433/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801433/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801433.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
