Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.. -- (C) Warner Bros.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/_kgudHWafDwqaVNEnjd7NGBfVZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/78/11167835_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/_kgudHWafDwqaVNEnjd7NGBfVZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/78/11167835_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/_kgudHWafDwqaVNEnjd7NGBfVZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/78/11167835_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/_kgudHWafDwqaVNEnjd7NGBfVZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/78/11167835_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Christian Bale","id":"162652645","characters":["Bruce Wayne/Batman"]},{"name":"Anne Hathaway","id":"162656190","characters":["Selina Kyle"]},{"name":"Tom Hardy","id":"391527059","characters":["Bane"]},{"name":"Marion Cotillard","id":"162688286","characters":["Miranda Tate"]},{"name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","id":"162666960","characters":["John Blake"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
